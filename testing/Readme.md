# Unit Test

Automatic testcases make life easer for developers.
After adding a new feature, the programmer can add
new cases to the pool of the existing testcases. And
then run (corresponding) testcases to keep code quality.

## C language

[cmocka quick start][cmocka quick start] (in this repo)
just "show me the code".
